<i>"Skeppsreddare's":https://www.instagram.com/lego_jani77/ build so far.</i>

*Where?* 

During the year's main event, "Pii Poo Helsinki 20.-21.9":https://www.piipoo.com/pages/rakennustapahtuma.

*How can I join?*

Register as an exhibitor on "Pii Poo's website":https://www.piipoo.com/pages/rakennustapahtuma (mention you're going to take part in the collaboration during registration), preferably mention on the forum planning thread what you're going to bring, and show up! It's that easy.

*What can we expect?*

<i>Here's what our previous Project Support collaboration looked like. You can find the entire thing on "Youtube":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug9v7ybNiXQ</i>

*What do I build?*

We'll provide a blue table tablecloth, so build with that in mind. You don't need to start building water with bricks, as the blue tablecloth will represent the ocean. You can simply build an island or a ship, put it on the tablecloth, and it will look authentic!

<i> "Tuusaland's":https://www.instagram.com/tuusaland/ build will incorporate some lively residents!</i>

*Can I build...?*

Ask in the "planning thread":https://www.palikkatakomo.org/forum/read.php?1,47465 if you're unsure, but pretty much everything from depictions of the national epic Kalevala to traditional 1850 villas will be seen on the collaboration. For example, Tuomas "TheQ":https://www.flickr.com/photos/infamousq/ Kukkamaa, Juho "FullBrickDev":https://www.instagram.com/fullbrickdev/ Valtavaara, and Daniel "Dimension":https://www.instagram.com/daniel_haav/ Haavisto are planning to do historical builds from the 1850s to 1900s. Tuomas is building Tervahovi, a port famous for exporting quality tar all over Europe. Juho is building the HMS Vulture, that participated in burning Tervahovi in 1854. The HMS Vulture was in the Baltic Sea during the Crimean war, along with Daniel's HMS Firefly, which participated in the attack against Wasa's shipbuilding centre.

*How big can my build be?*

Mention your build's size in the "planning thread":https://www.palikkatakomo.org/forum/read.php?1,47465. If your build is big, make sure it's ok beforehand! This way we can co-ordinate spacing easier. For example, "JK":https://www.instagram.com/erythron/'s lighthouse is 70cm tall - we will arrange some empty space next to it to accommodate its height and make it look better!
