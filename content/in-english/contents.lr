Palikkatakomo is Finnish LEGO hobbyist forum and the name of our LEGOÂ® Users' Group (LUG), which aims to advance the LEGO hobby in Finland. We do this by organizing contests at our forum and exhibitions all around Finland. Palikkatakomo is free for all and welcomes everyone. Word of warning, tho: Everything in Palikkatakomo is organized in Finnish so it is best that you know Finnish before joining our ranks.

Site is fully fan-based and the LEGO Group doesn't sponsor us at all.
